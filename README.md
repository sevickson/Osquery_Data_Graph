# Untangling the Osquery❓ tables web🕸 using Jupyter Notebooks📓 - Part 2 | With Data📜
This repository is used to hold Jupyter Notebooks that are used to work with Osquery table **DATA**.  

This work is based on my prior work on Osquery Tables:
- [Repository](https://github.com/sevickson/osquery_tables_graph)
- [Blog](https://medium.com/@sevickson/untangling-the-osquery-tables-web-using-jupyter-notebooks-7c979c03f42d)

This repository is divided as follows:
- [Generate Osquery Data](Generate_Osquery_Data.ipynb)
- [Create Graph Osquery Graphistry](Create_Graph_Osquery_Graphistry.ipynb)
- [REQ](REQ)
    - Requirements folder
- [Linux Get Data](Linux_Get_Data)
    - Jupyter Notebook and requirements to get Osquery on a Linux system

This repository is based on blog ...   
The graphs are based on Osquery data for Windows and Linux.

------------------------

From my prior work on `OSQuery-Tables` this repository handles following points:
- [X] Check the data returned from the tables when querying and use that data to further fine-tune the filtering.
- [X] Make it possible to use other column names to create graphs with, maybe based on same returned data from a query.
